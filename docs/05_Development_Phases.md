# **05_Development_Phases.md**

## **✅ Fully Detailed Development Phases & Checklists (Maximum Clarity)**

This version includes **even more granular details**, ensuring that a **new model or developer** would know **exactly** what gets built in each phase.  

---

## **📌 1️⃣ Overview of Development Phases**  

Each phase is structured so that **each feature is fully implemented and tested** before moving on.  

```plaintext
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 → Final Testing
```

✔ **Every system is self-contained per phase** → No dependencies left incomplete.  
✔ **Progress tracking ensures nothing is skipped**.

## **📌 2️⃣ Fully Detailed Development Checklist**  

### **🚀 Phase 1: Initial Setup**  

**Goal:** Establish the **core project structure** and initialize **Three.js with a functional rendering system**.  

✅ **File & Folder Setup**  

- [x] Create **project directory structure** under `kvWeb/`.  
- [x] Set up **index.html** for About Page.  
- [x] Create `about.js` as the **entry point** for logic.  
- [x] Set up **styles directory** and create `about-styles.css`.  
- [x] Create `helpers/` for shared scripts (scene setup, HUD, FTL, etc.).  

✅ **Three.js Scene Initialization (`sceneSetup.js`)**  

- [x] Initialize **Three.js renderer, camera, and scene**.  
- [x] Create **a perspective camera with default positioning**.  
- [x] Add **orbit controls** for debugging camera movement.  
- [x] Implement **basic ambient and directional lighting**.  
- [x] Render **a placeholder object (test sphere) to confirm scene is active**.  

✅ **Testing & Debugging**

- [x] Load `index.html` in a browser → Confirm **scene renders without errors**.  
- [x] Ensure **camera movement is functional**.  
- [x] Console log **scene initialization success**.

### **☀️ Phase 2: Sun & Planetary System**  

**Goal:** Implement the **sun with an animated corona**, then add **hardcoded planets with accurate orbits and rotations**.  

✅ **Sun Implementation (`sunSetup.js`)**  

- [x] Create a **high-resolution sphere** for the sun.  
- [x] Apply **emissive material** for natural glow.  
- [ ] Add **a soft animated corona effect** for realism.  
- [x] Adjust **lighting intensity to simulate real sun glare**.  

✅ **Hardcoded Planets & Orbits (`planetSetup.js`)**  

- [x] Create **an array of planet objects** (Earth, Mars, etc.).  
- [x] Assign **correct textures, sizes, and distances** for realism.  
- [x] Set **realistic axial tilt and rotation speed**.  
- [ ] Implement **circular orbits using simple trigonometry**.  
- [ ] Ensure planets **update position per frame** (animate orbits).  

✅ **Moons & Rings**  

- [x] Add **Luna (Earth’s moon) as a generated planet**.  
- [x] Store **Phobos & Deimos as 3D models** in `models/`.  
- [x] Implement **simple circular orbits for moons**.  
- [x] Add **ring systems for Saturn & Uranus using transparent textures**.  

✅ **Testing & Debugging**  

- [ ] Verify **planet orbits** are smooth and correctly positioned.  
- [ ] Ensure **sun corona effect animates without performance drops**.

### **🚀 Phase 3: Rocket & Navigation Mechanics**  

**Goal:** Implement **player movement, boosting, and collision detection**.  

✅ **Rocket Model & Scene Integration**  

- [ ] Load **rocket model** into the scene.  
- [ ] Position **starting point near Earth**.  

✅ **Movement System (`rocketControls.js`)**  

- [ ] Implement **WASD movement controls**.  
- [ ] Apply **acceleration-based movement (smooth movement, no instant stops)**.  
- [ ] Enable **camera to track the rocket** dynamically.  

✅ **Boosting System**  

- [ ] Assign **Shift key to temporary speed boost**.  
- [ ] Implement **boost cooldown & visual indicator in HUD**.  

✅ **Collision Handling**

- [ ] Implement **bounding sphere collisions for planets**.  
- [ ] Prevent **player from flying through planets**.  

✅ **Testing & Debugging**  

- [ ] Verify **movement & boost behavior**.  
- [ ] Ensure **collision system properly stops movement near planets**.  

---

### **📡 Phase 4: HUD & User Interface**

**Goal:** Implement the **HUD system to display essential player information**.  

✅ **HUD Framework (`hudManager.js`)**

- [ ] Create **basic HUD layout** for displaying data.  
- [ ] Implement **modular HUD panels** for flexibility.  

✅ **Dynamic Information Display**

- [ ] Display **current speed & boost status**.
- [ ] Show **current planet name when nearby**.  
- [ ] Implement **AI co-pilot message notifications**.  
- [ ] Create **docking prompt system (if near a planet, show "Press E to Dock")**.  

✅ **Testing & Debugging**

- [ ] Ensure **HUD updates dynamically as the player moves**.
