## **📌 Security & User Input Handling**
This document outlines **best practices for handling user inputs safely** and **preventing potential exploits or security issues**.

---

## **1️⃣ Overview of Security & User Input Handling**
The goal is to **ensure that all user interactions are safe**, prevent unintended behavior, and **protect against future online or persistent data risks**.

```plaintext
Sanitized Inputs → Prevent Exploits → Ensure Stability → Plan for Future Security Needs
```

✔ **Filters & sanitizes user inputs to prevent unintended actions.**  
✔ **Prevents potential exploits (e.g., infinite boost, unintended FTL jumps).**  
✔ **Designed with flexibility for possible future online expansion.**

## **2️⃣ Input Handling & Sanitization**
All **user inputs must be validated and sanitized** to prevent crashes or exploits.

✅ **General Input Handling Rules:**  
- [ ] **Limit input ranges** (e.g., no negative values for movement speed).  
- [ ] **Ensure proper key mapping** (prevent unwanted key interference).  
- [ ] **Debounce repeated keypresses** (prevent spamming inputs).  

✅ **Movement & Boosting Protections (`rocketControls.js`)**  
- [ ] Prevent **holding down boost infinitely** (cooldown & energy management).  
- [ ] Ensure **speed does not exceed max threshold**.  
- [ ] Ignore **input commands if player is docked or in FTL jump**.  

✅ **Docking & Interaction Safety (`dockingSystem.js`)**  
- [ ] Only **allow docking when within a valid range**.  
- [ ] Prevent **spamming docking to trigger unintended behavior**.  
- [ ] Ensure **undocking does not leave the player stuck inside a planet**.  

✅ **FTL Transition Safety (`ftlSystem.js`)**  
- [ ] Disable **FTL jumps when already in transit**.  
- [ ] Ensure **FTL menu cannot be triggered while docked**.  
- [ ] Apply **a short cooldown after FTL travel** to prevent rapid transitions.

## **3️⃣ Exploit Prevention & Safeguards**
Security measures to prevent **intentional or unintentional game-breaking behavior**.  

✅ **Game Loop & Physics Safety**  
- [ ] Ensure **all physics updates are controlled by the engine** (no frame-dependent movement).  
- [ ] Validate **object positions before applying movement updates**.  

✅ **Memory & Performance Protection**  
- [ ] Prevent **unlimited object creation** (limit instances of UI popups, logs, or animations).  
- [ ] Ensure **garbage collection properly disposes of unused objects**.  

✅ **Debug Mode Restrictions**  
- [ ] Prevent **debug mode from being activated during FTL jumps or docking**.  
- [ ] Ensure **debug information does not persist between sessions**.

## **4️⃣ Future Security Considerations**
If **multiplayer or persistent data** is introduced, additional security measures must be implemented:  

🔹 **If Online Features Are Added:**  
- [ ] Prevent **client-side manipulation of speed, fuel, or health values**.  
- [ ] Implement **server-side verification for key actions**.  
- [ ] Sanitize **any user-generated content (planet names, player input fields).**  

🔹 **If Persistent Data Is Added:**  
- [ ] Ensure **saved game states cannot be easily modified by users**.  
- [ ] Encrypt or validate **player progress files to prevent cheating**.
